# The plan

* Apply thinking about how decisions are made, and on what information.
* Consider the use of, and loss of, collective intelligence, and the role of
  herd thinking.
* Discuss an example where the decision was controversial, where the outcome
  is now (mostly) known, and may well have had negative consequences.

# Groupthink

First coined by [@janis1972victims] discussing Bay of Pigs invasion.

# Bay of Pigs

* Planned under Eisenhower administration, executed by Kennedy.
* 15 April 1961 - CIA-supplied B26 bombers bomb Cuban airfields.
* 17 April — 1400 CIA-funded paramilitaries landed in Bay of Pigs.
* Soon opposed by about 20,000 Cuban troops.
* Kennedy withdraws [further planned air
  support](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13066561)
* 20 April — surrender.

# Putting the group into groupthink

> There were 50 or so of us, presumably the most experienced and smartest
people we could get, to plan such an operation. Most of us thought it would
work. ... But five minutes after it began to fall in, we all looked at each
other and asked, 'How could we have been so stupid?'. [Time
article](https://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,106537,00.html).

# Groups and groupthink

> [The advisors] never pressed, partly out of a fear of being labeled ‘soft’ or
undaring in the eyes of their colleagues. (Janis 1972).


> ... senior officials were unanimous for going ahead… Had one senior advisor
opposed the adventure, I believe that Kennedy would have canceled it. No one
spoke against it." (Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.)

# Background to problem 1 — homeopathy and cholera

* The government anticipated the cholera epidemic of 1854.
* It sacked a competent Board of Health and appointed an eminent one.
* This Board produced multiple confused reports that failed to take Snow's
  observations into account.
* It did produce mortality figures for the London hospitals.

See [@hempel2014medical; @paneth1998rivalry].

# Background — homeopathy and cholera

In the 1854 Cholera epidemic:

* London Homeopathic Hospital (LHH) : 10 deaths of 61 cases admitted (16.4%)
  (this information did not appear in the Board's reports).
* Middlesex hospital : 123 / 231 cases (53.2%) (this did appear).

(LHH)](https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/our-services/our-hospitals/royal-london-hospital-integrated-medicine/history-royal-london-hospital-integrated-medicine)


# Background to problem — Covid-19 and childhood vaccination

* [UK: 38.6% uptake of vaccination for 18-29 years
  old](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19latestinsights/vaccines#vaccine-uptake-by-demographic)
* [Vaccine hestitancy and
  Covid](https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/has-covid-19-threatened-routine-childhood-vaccination-insights-us-public-opinion-polls)

# Myocarditis

Clinical myocarditis after second dose in 12-17 year old males, after Covid
vaccination:

* [1 in 2,680 after dose 2 in Hong Kong](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34849657)
* [1 in 2,650 in Kaiser Permanente health
  system](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.21.21268209v1)

Subclinical - rate unclear, but:

* A Thai study showed [2.3% raised cardiac biomarker or lab study
  positive]([https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202208.0151/v1) after Pfizer
  vaccination.
* In a study in Swiss health-care employees ["vaccine-associated myocardial
  injury was adjudicated in 22 participants \[of 777\] (2.8%
  ..."](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ejhf.2978).

olds](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7023e1.htm#:~:text=COVID%2D19%20adolescent%20hospitalization%20rates,rose%20to%201.3%20in%20April)

* Fact-checkers and "misinformation".

# Your second task

It is January 2021.  The Covid mRNA vaccine has been approved and is being
rolled out for adults.  There is, as yet, no clear sign about vaccine harms,
but you know this is an as-yet little-tested and novel vaccine delivery method.
You are the leader of a group that will give advice to the governor of a US
state on their policy for Covid vaccination for children and adolescents.

* What recommendation do you give in January 2021?  Do you recommend childhood
  vaccination?
* What will you do to try and engage the public in *carrying out* your
  recommendations?
* What will you do to try and engage the public in *reviewing* your
  recommendations?
* A member of the team proposes engaging a state university in collaborating
  with social media to deal with disinformation.  What is your response?  What
  engagement should there be with social media about your recommendations.
