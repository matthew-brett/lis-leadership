# How not be wrong

# Background to problem 1 — homeopathy and cholera

* The government anticipated the cholera epidemic of 1854.
* It sacked a competent Board of Health and appointed an eminent one.
* This Board produced multiple confused reports that failed to take Snow's
  observations into account.
* It did produce mortality figures for the London hospitals.

See [@hempel2014medical; @paneth1998rivalry].

# Background — homeopathy and cholera

In the 1854 Cholera epidemic:

* London Homeopathic Hospital (LHH) : 10 deaths of 61 cases admitted (16.4%)
  (this information did not appear in the Board's reports).
* Middlesex hospital : 123 / 231 cases (53.2%) (this did appear).

See [this page on the London Homeopathic Hospital
(LHH)](https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/our-services/our-hospitals/royal-london-hospital-integrated-medicine/history-royal-london-hospital-integrated-medicine)

# Your task

Imagine yourself, as far as you can, as being a contemporary of the events, in
1854 and 1855.   The epidemic is over, but cholera continues to be a major
health risk, of national concern.

* You are the Board.  You have the figures for the LHH.  You do not believe
  homeopathy is an effective treatment.  Do you release the figures?  If so, why?  If not, why not?
* You are an MP.  Someone has pointed out the missing figures for LHH.  How do
  you respond?
* You are an administrator in a hospital.  The figures are confirmed.  How do
  you respond?

# Background to problem 2 — Covid-19 and masks

With apology for US-focus.

* Feb 29 2020 : Surgeon general tweets "STOP BUYING MASKS!  They are NOT
  effective in preventing general public from catching coronavirus ..."
